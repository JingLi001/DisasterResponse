### ETL pipeline
Load the raw csv-file provided, extract the messages and categories as a dataframe, clean the data and load it into an SQLite database.
### Machine Learning pipeline
Build a machine learning pipeline using NLTK, as well as scikit-learn's pipeline and GridSearchCV, export the model to a pickle file.
